# Bubble Chart

*Goal*: I'd like to use D3js to display all the skills I have as awesome bubbles that are fun to explore

* Use the same color for skills within the same category (eg, backend, frontend, IT, PM)
* Simple labels, then more info when zooming/clicking on the bubbles
* Buttons that will resort the bubbles in different ways (maybe showing only strengths, or showing only recent skills)

*How-to*: To see this working:

1. pull the repo
2. run a simple web server (eg `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)

*Current State*: 

* Chart clusters nodes as tightly as possible
* Mouseover/out behavior zooms in on node
* Minor styling
* Chart reads from csv file
